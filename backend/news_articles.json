            "summary": "A unique and heartfelt exhibition, titled Roses of Humanity, allows visitors in Lahore to stroll through a rose garden made of hand-stitched roses paying homage to 15,000 children killed during the genocide in Gaza. The tribute installation, organised by Labour & Love in collaboration with Bargain Basement Sale (BBS), offers an immersive experience that showcases love and affection for the resilient people of Gaza, while not shying away from confronting the stark and haunting realities of their daily lives. It is on display at the Alhamra Cultural Complex’s Ustad Allah Bux Gallery 4 till May 18.  A gentle breeze laced with the faint fragrance of roses guided visitors toward the exhibition opening on Friday evening — evoking an eerie sense of collective grief. “As you walk through the rose garden you will see 15,000 handmade roses, all of which have been stitched by the women artisans of Labour & Love,” Nuria Rafique-Iqbal, who conceptualised and provided direction for the exhibition, told visitors outside the gallery on the opening day. “Each such rose represents a child that has died in Gaza since October 7, 2023. Every single flower that you see represents one child,” she explained. The data comprising the names of all the children killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza was made accessible with the help of the Shireen Observatory, a not-for-profit organisation which tracks killings and attacks by Israeli forces, Rafique-Iqbal, who is affiliated with both Labour & Love and BBS, told the visitors. She shared that “recycled reused cut pieces of fabric” have been used to make the roses. “The roses reflect the diversity of mankind and the beauty of unity forming into one gigantic rose.”"
